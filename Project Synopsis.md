### SymMath UI

**Problem Statement/Opportunity**
When faced with mathematical problems, an typical student solve it by first writing the given data and then framing the equations relevant to the question. Finally, a student solves the problem through some mathematical steps on the data.
However, often during this looong process, students lose track of equations and data.
SymMath UI aims to solve it by keeping list of the data and variables and performing the mathematical steps. This would enable students to gain insight on algebra and calculus. 
The list of equations would also sync across devices so students can continue to work on a given problem from a different platform.

**Project Description**
SymMath UI provides a platform for symbolic computation using SymPy in a easy to use GUI.

The aim of the project is to give students the ability to perform mathematical symbolic operations on equations while introducing them to operations in symbolic computation. All of these is done by providing the users with a GUI that internally parses and inteligently suggests users what operation to perform.

The use of this project would then enable the user solve difficult algebra and calculus problems easily by enabling them to keep track of equations and data.

The application also syncs the data across devices using Azure services so students can continue to work on a given problem from a different platform.
